API Version 11112020. November 11th, 2020.


Storage and Retrieval of Data:
    + node.js file system (fs) module reads and writes JSON files
        + Stores Account object as JSON after charge or pay
        + Looks for and reads Account JSON file if it exists or creates base account 'IS'
            + 'IS' is initialized with a credit limit of 10
            + A charge of 1 and a payment of 1 are performed and added to Ledger
        + Stores Ledger object as JSON file and retrieves it, or initializes a base ledger with an entry of 0 from 'System' to 'System' 


Supported Views:
    + Charge or Pay
        + Charge or Pay (accountUI.js) runs on port 8081
        + URL: http://localhost:8081
    + Credit View
        + Credit View (creditUI.js) runs on port 8082
        + URL: http://localhost:8082


Startup Terminal or Command Promt Instructions:
