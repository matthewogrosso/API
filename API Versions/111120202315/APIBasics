Two node.js server instances:
    + local on port 8080 for API (api.js)
    + local on port 8081 for browser interface (accountUI.js)

The browser interface calls API on port 8080 through XHTMLRequest with information entered in form on port 8081.

API calls to charge or pay toward an account balance for a particular provider trigger those transactions being written to a Ledger object as well as a Ledger file on the server for persistent storage of transactions across node reboots.

During node.js server operation of api.js running on port 8080 Account and Ledger objects are created from scratch or from the local files storing account information and ledger transactions.
